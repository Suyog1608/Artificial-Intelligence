Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Mimicking the Brain

    ANNs are a machine learning type structured like the human brain, using layers of neurons.
    
    Deep Learning ANNs have many hidden layers, enabling them to find complex patterns in large datasets.

Image Classification Example: Dog or Not Dog

    Task: Binary classification of an image as containing a dog or not.

    Input Layer: Image is broken down into pixels (e.g., 25x25 pixels = 625 input neurons)

    Hidden Layers:
        Neurons each have an activation function, deciding whether to pass data forward.
        Data moves through multiple hidden layers for pattern analysis.

        Output Layer: In this case, two neurons: 'dog' and 'not dog'.

Feedforward Neural Networks

    Data moves from the input layer, through hidden layers, and to the output layer in a left-to-right motion.

Self-tuning Capabilities

    A key strength of ANNs is their ability to adjust themselves.

    Supervised learning: The network tunes itself based on successful or unsuccessful identification.
