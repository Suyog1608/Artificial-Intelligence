Humans and Data Classification

    We naturally classify information (e.g., organizing files, separating contacts) for better organization.

    Businesses have similar needs (sorting customers by frequency, spending habits, etc.).

Binary Classification in Machine Learning

    It's a popular supervised learning method with two possible outcomes (yes/no, fraud/not fraud, spam/not spam).

    Supervised learning requires a labeled training dataset to teach the system how to classify data.

Examples of Binary Classification

    Credit card fraud detection: Systems learn to identify fraudulent transactions based on a training set.

    Spam filtering: Networks are trained on examples of spam messages for future filtering.

Data Scientists' Role

    They define the categories for classification (e.g., fraud, spam).

    The AI system classifies data into these human-created categories based on its training.

Challenges of Classification

    Requires significant upfront investment to obtain and label a large training dataset.

    Accuracy may initially be low, requiring continuous refinement of the training set.
    
    This explains why systems like fraud detection might sometimes generate false positives.
