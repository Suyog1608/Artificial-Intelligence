Problem Definition

    Goal: Classify images as "dog" or "not dog."

    Type: Binary classification (two categories)

    Approach: Supervised machine learning with labeled training data.

Algorithm Selection

    Standard Algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor or Naive Bayes could work.
    
    Neural Network: Chosen due to the complexity of image data, requiring an artificial neural network.

Neural Network Setup

    Structure: Input layer (image pixels), hidden layers, and output layer with two nodes (dog/not dog).

    Initialization: Weights are randomly assigned, biases are set to zero.

Training Process

    Feeding the Data: The labeled training set is used.

    Early Guesses: Initially, predictions are not much better than random.

    Error Calculation: The network compares its prediction to the correct label.

    Adjustments: Gradient descent determines how much to change weights and biases.

    Backpropagation: Errors are propagated backwards, 'tuning' the network to reduce the cost function.

Testing

    Unlabeled Data: The test set is used to measure the network's performance on new, unseen images.

    Overfitting Check: A huge accuracy difference between training and testing sets can indicate overfitting.


Key Takeaway: This process involves choosing the right approach, setting up the network, training with labeled data, and testing on new data. Adjustments and refinements may be needed for optimal results.
