Diversity of Human Intelligence

    Humans exhibit various forms of intelligence, such as linguistic, scientific, artistic, or mathematical aptitude.

    Lack of a single standard for intelligence makes it harder to definitively label computers as "intelligent."

Computers: Exceeding Humans in Specific Areas

    Computers excel at tasks with clearly defined rules and patterns.

    Early computers surpassed humans in checkers, and this trend continues with DeepMind's success in Go.

    Despite mastery, computers may not understand the game's purpose or their own actions, merely demonstrating rule-following and pattern-matching abilities.

Defining Artificial Intelligence (AI)

    Traditional definition of AI: Systems exhibiting behavior interpretable as human intelligence.

    This definition is subjective and can lead to conflicting viewpoints (chess program vs. home assistant vs. Google chatbot).

    Question arises: Is true intelligence present, or is it just a system designed to appear intelligent?

AI & Human Intelligence: Different Foundations

    AI's strength lies within worlds of defined rules and data.

    Businesses operating in structured environments will benefit most from AI initially.
    
    This explains AI's success in search, e-commerce, and games.

Assessing AI's Impact on Your Organization

    Focus on areas where your company heavily relies on pattern matching, set rules, and probabilities. These are prime starting points for integrating AI into your operations.
