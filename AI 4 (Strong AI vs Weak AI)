Strong AI vs. Weak AI

Philosopher John Searle proposed two categories of AI:

    Strong AI: Machines that mimic the full range of human intelligence â€“ emotions, humor, sense of purpose. This is the realm of sci-fi characters (C-3PO, Commander Data).

    Weak AI: Machines confined to narrow tasks (Siri, image sorting). Most current AI development focuses on this type.


The Limitations of Symbolic Systems (and Early AI)

    Expert systems in the 70s/80s were a form of weak AI. Designed to follow expert-defined steps for problem-solving, like medical diagnosis.

    While appearing intelligent, they are essentially pattern matching based on programmed responses (like Searle's Chinese Room).

    These faced issues with combinatorial explosion (too many patterns to manage).

The Legacy of Symbolic Systems

    Despite limitations, symbolic systems laid groundwork for AI.
    
    The term GOFAI ("Good Old-Fashioned AI") is still used to describe them.
