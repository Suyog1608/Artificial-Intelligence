Regression Analysis: Understanding Trends

    Example: A car sales company used seasonal patterns to predict vehicle type preferences.

    Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that analyzes the relationship between predictors (like season) and an outcome (like vehicle sales).

Key Concepts

    Predictors/Independent Variables: Factors you believe influence the outcome (e.g., the month of the year).

    Outcome: What you want to predict (e.g., sales of a specific vehicle type).

    Trend Lines: Regression aims to find the best-fit line through plotted data, revealing the relationship between predictors and outcome.

How Regression Works

    Training Data: Labeled data with known outcomes is used.

    Prediction vs. Outcome: The system makes predictions, which are compared to the real outcome in the training data.

    Refinement: The process repeats to improve the accuracy of predictions.

Applications of Regression

    Retailers (like Walmart) use regression to predict buying trends and stock shelves accordingly (e.g., Pop-Tarts in summer).
    
    Companies can match product availability to peak customer interest.

Debate: Is Regression True Machine Learning?

    Some argue that regression is primarily about prediction, not learning new insights.
