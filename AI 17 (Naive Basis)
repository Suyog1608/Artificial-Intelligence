Naive Bayes: Classifying Based on Multiple Features

    A popular machine learning algorithm that assumes independence between predictors.

Why "Naive"?

    It treats each feature (predictor) as completely independent, even when they might be related in reality.

Example: Dog Breed Classification

    Classes: Terrier, Hound, Sport Dog

    Predictors: Hair length, Height, Weight

    Class Predictor Probability: Naive Bayes calculates the probability of the unknown dog belonging to each class based on each feature individually.

How Naive Bayes Works

    Training Data: Data with known classes and predictors is used.

    Independent Probability Calculation: Probability is calculated for each feature's likelihood of indicating a specific class (e.g., 40% chance a dog with this hair length is a Terrier).

    Overall Classification: The algorithm selects the class with the highest combined probability across all features.

Applications of Naive Bayes

    Fraud Detection: Banks analyze banking features (predictors) independently, calculating the probability of a fraudulent transaction.
    
    Cybersecurity: Security threats are flagged by assessing the likelihood of a threat based on various features.

Key Takeaway

    Naive Bayes' simplicity (assuming feature independence) makes it well-suited for tasks where the relationships between features are less important or unknown.
