KNN: Learning by Comparing Neighbors

    Inspired by the real-world example of classifying unknown dog breeds by comparing them to known breeds.
    
    KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm for multi-class classification (more than two possible categories).

How KNN Works

    Plotting Data: New data is plotted alongside existing, labeled data.

    Features as Predictors: Key features (like weight, hair length) are chosen to classify data points.

    Distance Calculation: Euclidean distance is a common method to calculate how close data points are to each other.

    Finding Nearest Neighbors: The algorithm identifies the 'K' closest labeled neighbors to the new data point. (K is a user-defined number, like 5 in our example).

    Classification by Majority: The new data point is classified based on the most common breed among its nearest neighbors (shepherd in the example).

Key Points about KNN

    The shorter the distance to neighbors, the more likely the classification is accurate.
    K (the number of neighbors) is important to control - impact accuracy.

    KNN is simple and powerful, with applications beyond animal classification into areas like finance.
