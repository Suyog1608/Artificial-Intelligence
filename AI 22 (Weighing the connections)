Humans and Weights: The Dog Example

    We instinctively apply weights (positive or negative) to features we see when making predictions.
    Example: Dog is more likely in a grassy field (positive weight) than in a desert (negative weight).

Artificial Neural Networks: Mimicking Our Approach

    ANNs also use weights to create connections between neurons, allowing for nuanced adjustments of the model.

Weights as Tuning Knobs

    Think of weights like the tuning knobs on a guitar. They adjust the strength of the connections within the network.

Structure of a Neural Network with Weights

    Neurons in hidden layers are connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer.
    Each connection has an associated weight (e.g., W1, W2...), adding a massive number of connections and weights.

Supervised Learning Tunes the Weights

    Similar to other supervised learning techniques, ANNs use training data to adjust weights for accurate predictions.
    Weights are initially assigned randomly by the system.
    Through training, the network iteratively refines the weights to find the "best tune" for predictions.
