The Internet of Things (IoT)

    IoT devices are sensor-equipped objects that connect and share data over the internet. Examples include smartwatches, thermostats, and doorbells.
    This connectivity creates enormous amounts of data about user location, habits, and even health.

IoT and AI: A Powerful Partnership

    AI is crucial for analyzing the vast data generated by IoT devices, revealing patterns and enabling quick reactions.
    This combination allows companies to predict behavior and tailor product offerings.

Examples and Privacy Concerns

    Early Alexa devices highlighted how conversations could influence Amazon recommendations.
    Ring doorbells, combined with facial recognition, create a vast surveillance network used by law enforcement.
    IoT medical devices offer vast potential for pattern-based health insights but raise privacy questions about the collected data.

IoT's Impact: Extending Machine Learning into the Physical World

    IoT devices allow machine learning's pattern-finding power to track offline behavior, not just online actions.
    This has massive implications for targeted advertising and product offerings based on user needs and location.
