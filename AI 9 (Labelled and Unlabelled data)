Machine Learning Strategies: Mimicking Human Learning

    Supervised Learning: Similar to having a tutor, the machine is given "labeled" data â€“ examples with correct answers provided. This guides the system's learning.

    Unsupervised Learning: Resembles observing in the park. The machine analyzes "unlabeled" data without answers, seeking patterns on its own.

Pros and Cons

    Supervised: Requires knowledgeable input for labeling data. Can be very efficient in learning specific tasks.

    Unsupervised: Needs vast amounts of data to identify patterns. Less reliant on expert input but may uncover unexpected insights.

Applications for Businesses

    Supervised example: Identifying high-spending customers on Amazon. The company labels past customers, allowing the system to find patterns associated with that behavior.
    
    Unsupervised example: Discovering a link between chessboard purchases and later buying high-end appliances. This pattern could be used for targeted advertising.

Key Takeaway: Both supervised and unsupervised learning offer valuable ways to extract insights from data, each with its own strengths and ideal applications.
