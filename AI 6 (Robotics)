Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World

    Robotics focuses on machines performing physical tasks (manufacturing, deliveries, self-driving vehicles).

    Historically, robots were highly specialized and limited in their capabilities.

Robotics + Machine Learning = Increased Adaptability

    Combining robotics with machine learning allows machines to adapt to environments and learn new tasks.

    Example: Self-driving cars use machine learning and sensors to navigate complex road situations, recognizing different objects and scenarios.

    Training the AI network with data is crucial, hence the need for human supervision initially.

Data vs. Simple Mechanics in Self-Driving Cars

    Google emphasizes the data challenge in self-driving cars: making the right driving decisions, not just the mechanics of steering.

Two Approaches in Robotics

    Some robots still rely on traditional "good old-fashioned AI" (symbolic reasoning, pre-programming), like the Roomba.
    
    This approach is common where errors in the physical world carry a high cost (e.g., a robot handling medication).
