Clustering vs. Classification

    Classification uses predefined, human-created categories (supervised learning).
    Clustering relies on the machine to discover its own groups within the data (unsupervised learning).

Example: "Frequently Bought Together"

    Online stores analyze purchasing patterns using unsupervised learning to suggest additional items. It creates clusters based on what people buy together.

The Halloween Candy Analogy

    Supervised learning: Son classifies candy using familiar categories with your guidance.
    Unsupervised learning: Son creates his own clusters (size, color, even "perfume candy") when faced with unfamiliar Serbian candy.

Advantages of Clustering

    Works well with vast amounts of unlabeled data, where creating human categories is impractical.
    Allows for the discovery of unexpected patterns that humans might miss.

Applications of Clustering

    Clustering customers to identify patterns and segment the market.
    Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Twitter leverage clustering to understand user behavior, preferences, and connections.

Key Takeaway: Clustering offers a powerful tool for discovering patterns in data when predefined categories aren't available or when you seek insights beyond obvious classifications.
