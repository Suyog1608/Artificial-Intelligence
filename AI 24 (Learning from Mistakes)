Quantifying Wrongness: The Cost Function

    Neural networks need to measure how wrong a prediction is, not just if it's right or wrong.

    The cost function provides this measure. A higher cost means a more inaccurate prediction.

Example: Dog vs. Cat vs. Mountain

    Misidentifying a cat as a dog has a small cost.

    Misidentifying a mountain as a dog has a much higher cost, signaling a need for greater adjustment.

Gradient Descent: Correcting the Trajectory

    Like adjusting the angle of a dart throw, gradient descent calculates how to tweak weights and biases based on the severity of the error.

    The aim: Gradually 'descend' towards the optimal prediction.

Backpropagation (Backprop)

    A key innovation in neural networks.

    With feedforward networks (data moving left to right), errors are propagated backwards for adjustment.

    Backprop allows the network to apply gradient descent based on its calculated wrongness.
    
Key Takeaway: Gradient descent and backpropagation allow neural networks to precisely adjust their weights and biases in response to error, improving their accuracy over time.
